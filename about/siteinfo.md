## Ah, I see, you've come for the juicy technical details...

You can find the Github repository for the site right [here](https://github.com/awenllais/awenllais.com) if you want to snoop!
It was built using Eleventy's base blog template which you can check out the repository for [here](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy-base-blog)...

I followed [this fantastic guide](https://crimsontome.com/posts/making-your-own-blog/) from CrimsonTome (who was also kind enough to sit with me as I sobbed my way through some (probably very basic) documentation) - you can check out her blog [here](https://crimsontome.com/)! - it is very cool and I hope that one day my site will be as cool as hers ╰(*´︶`*)╯

This site is hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) which is very nice indeed! Perhaps one day it will move, but I've just got it all comfy and cosy on Netlify so she's probably not going to be moving for a little while.
