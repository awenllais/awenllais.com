Hi there! I'm sure you've journeyed (relatively) far to make it here, so I'll keep it short:
I'm Awen, a current student of the technological dark arts (Computer Science) just doing my best to scrape through as my ADHD-riddled brain focuses on silly little projects like this! But alas, the impulsivity of buying a domain means that I have to use it for *something* - so here we are!

Other than the ADHD, I'm a wife, a mother, and a live-laugh-lover (I am not a wife nor a mother, unless you count my two pet snails...) - slightly obessesed with the colour pink, and also a morning person (or I like to pretend to be) - a Buzzfeed quiz once said my Disney Princess bestie was Cinderella, and I've been riding that high ever since.

This little page isn't any sort of detail about me, unfortunately, but you can contact me on Discord @ Faeryne#7457, or pop me an email at awenllais@outlook.com

Anyway, best wishes to you on your continuing journey, and I hope the next stop treats you well!
